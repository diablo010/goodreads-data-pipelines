# Pandas Analysis of Goodreads Book Data

This project demonstrates **data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights extraction** of Goodreads book data using Pandas.


## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Dataset

The dataset used is `books.csv`, stored in the `dataset/` folder.

Ensure the notebook file path correctly points to this CSV.

## Overview
This analysis focuses on:

- Data Loading – Load CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.

- Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, inconsistent data types, and mixed date formats.

- Aggregation & Queries – Grouping, filtering, and ranking data (similar to SQL operations).

- Insights – Highlight patterns such as most popular publishers, books, and authors.

## How to Run 
#### 1. Open the notebook:

``` bash
jupyter notebook "Analysis/pandas-analysis/books_pandas_analysis.ipynb"
```

#### 2. Run each cell to reproduce the analysis and extract insights.
